		<h3> About Me... </h3>
	<p> Hi! I'm Ashley. I'm a pretty rad lady who enjoys surfing the web and the ocean waves...I also make really corny Dad jokes. Please don't be surprised by these tendencies. I have a vivaious personality with an purpose for drive. I am particularly interested in wine making, coding, and surfing. Wine has always been a huge part of my life. My parents always had some kind of social event going on and I would tend to play hostess. Which meant I had to wine and dine the guests. Later on in life I would become a sommelier and work at a fine dining restaraunt in Atlanta, Georgia.  </p>
