				<h4><strong>Program Manager, Global Intelligence,</strong>, Uber <small> 2016 - present</small></h4>
				<p>Uber’s internal “CIA” for competitive intelligence. Focus on collecting and delivering
					accurate competitive data to key business leaders to help strategic decision
					making. My responsibilities include collecting competition related business metrics (from vendors and working with operation teams) worldwide to facilitate decision making, and collaborating with teams from multiple functions (engineering, product, data science, operation, finance, BD) and deliver intel to exec teams.</p>
			

			
				<h4><strong>2nd local employee</strong>, Uber China <small>2013 - 2016</small></h4>
				<p>I joined Uber in late 2013 as the company just started Asia expansion. I was the 
					2nd local employee Uber hired for China. (it was my senior year in college and I 
					decided to join Uber instead of finishing my second semester.)</p>
				<p>In 2014 I helped launching 3 of Uber’s first 4 cities in China (Guangzhou,Shenzhen, Beijing) and was part of the team that created People’s Uber - Uber’s biggest and fastest growing product in China.</p>
				<p>In 2015, I was responsible for Uber China’s driver onboarding and activation process. My team activated 3 millions partners onto the platform and was an important contributing factor to the Uber China’s 198 time growth in 2015.</p>
				<p>In 2016, I transferred to China Growth product team in San Francisco. In August 2016, Uber China merged with Didi Chuxing at $7 billion valuation.</p>
			

			
				<h4><strong>Cofounder and Tech journalist</strong>, pingwest.com <small> 2012 - 2014</small></h4>
				<p>While I was stopping out of college in Silicon Valley back in 2012, I became one of the first Chinese tech journalists in Silicon Valley. I started as 36kr.com’s first oversea writer and later joined the founding team of Pingwest.com.</p>
