		<h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="img/jack.jpg" alt="text description"> 

        <p>My idea for the future integrates two primary and related themes: alternative governance/free market innovation and global entrepreneurship, for which twin interests I have dedicated myself to in the past and will continue to do so for my life and career.</p>

		<p>Coming from a huge emerging market, I have always been passionated about startups. I stopped out of college after my sophomore year applying for the 20 Under 20 Thiel Fellowship (as one of the first Chinese applicants). During that time, I worked at Seasteading Institute founded by Patri Friedman, entrepreneur and grandson of Milton Friedman as well as Blueseed, a project to put a ship outside of SF coastline to host entrepreneurs from around the world that gained global publicity. Both projects were supported by Peter Thiel. I was also one of the first Chinese tech journalists in Silicon Valley, and co-founded Pingwest.com, one of the most influential Chinese tech media.</p>

		<p>In late 2013, I joined Uber Asia as one of the earliest employees, and one of the founding members of Uber China. In the past two years, I worked at Uber China on almost every single aspect of the operation, from setting up its business in its earliest cities (now the biggest markets of Uber worldwide) to running a national function. Uber China was the fastest growing part of Uber, with its business has grown >10000 times since I joined. In August 2016, Uber China merged with Didi Chuxing at $7 billion valuation. This year, I transferred to San Francisco to work on the International growth product team, continue to support product innovations worldwide.</p>
