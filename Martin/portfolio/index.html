<img src="img/MartyRacing.jpg" />

<p> I was born in Sacramento, Ca. on January 19, 1975. Moved to Clovis, Ca.<strong>(Next to Fresno)</strong> in 1983. 
 I have been raised in the country for the first 22 years of my life. I grew up with Dogs, Horses and Dirtbikes.
 I was taught to drive heavy equipment since I was 12. I would help my family plow snow in the Sierra Nevada's. It was very long hours and little pay since I was working for the family.</p>

 <p>In 1998 I was offered a job to work for one of the telecom giants. Upon accepting the offer, it did require that I move to the Bay Area. Fastforwarding to 2005. I started my own business as a licensed vehicle registration service.</p>

 <p> As for my personal life, I have always been a very active and adventerous individual. Started snowboarding since the age of 16. I have been to almost every resort in California. Even the crappy ones. My true passions other than this coding class is Jiu Jitsu and CrossCountry Mountain Biking.</p> 

<p> I have 2 beautiful kids. My son is 9 and my daughter is 6. They are my first priority in life other than taking this class.</p>
